## About

This project's purpose is to take crypto data from the [Coin Gecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) and display them in a aesthetic way.

## Design Process and Methodology

Since I am using Bootstrap to design this project, I am using a mobile-first design methodology. To get an idea of the layout of how I want to have the elements displayed on a page I made sketches in Google Drawings. Then once the rough layout was designed, a first draft was created using Figma.

### Google Drawing Sketches

Every element in the page is displayed using containers or blocks. They also must be placed either vertically or horizontally. Below are images of this idea. Each element will go into a box, blue for horizontal containers (Elements inside blue are aligned horizontally) or red for vertical containers (Elements inside red are aligned vertically).
