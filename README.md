# Crypto Tracker

## About

This project's purpose is to take crypto data from the [Coin Gecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) and display them in a aesthetic way. It allows users to track and view information about different cryptocurrencies.

This is my second project while at John Bryce - studying web development.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of cryptocurrencies with their symbols and names. Users can click on the "More Info" button to view additional information about a specific coin, such as its current price.
- **Search**: Users can search for coins by entering the coin symbol or name in the search bar.
- **Live Reports**: Provides real-time updates and charts for the selected cryptocurrency.
- **Favorites**: Users can mark coins as favorites to easily track their prices and receive notifications.
